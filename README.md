Supermarket Sales Analysis and Visualization
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing a global supermarket dataset. The dataset contains details such as product lines, sales figures, prices, branch locations worldwide, quantities sold, and the payment methods used by customers. The objective of the analysis is to uncover valuable insights regarding the supermarket's performance across different product categories and locations.

Dataset Description
The dataset used for this analysis includes the following key attributes:

Product Line: The category of the product sold (e.g., electronics, groceries).
Sales: The total sales generated for each product line.
Price: The price of the products in each transaction.
Supermarket Branch: The branch location where the transaction took place.
Quantity Sold: The number of items sold per transaction.
Payment Method: The mode of payment used by customers (e.g., cash, credit card, digital payment).
Objectives
Analyze sales performance across different product lines and branches.
Visualize sales trends based on branch locations to understand regional performance.
Identify customer preferences for payment methods.
Correlate pricing with quantities sold to determine the effect of pricing strategies.
Tools and Technologies
Power BI: Used for data visualization and dashboard creation to showcase key findings.
Excel: For initial data cleaning, transformation, and preliminary analysis.
SQL (Optional): Used for querying the dataset for deeper insights and aggregations.
Analysis and Insights
Product Line Performance: Certain product lines consistently outperform others in terms of sales volume and revenue. Visualizing sales across product categories helps identify these trends.
Branch-Level Analysis: The data is broken down by branch locations worldwide, allowing for comparison of performance across regions.
Customer Payment Preferences: Insights into which payment methods are preferred in different regions, enabling better service adjustments based on customer behavior.
Sales vs. Price: Analyzing how product pricing impacts the number of items sold to optimize future pricing strategies.
Visualizations
The analysis results are presented through interactive dashboards built in Power BI. These include:

Sales by Product Line: A breakdown of revenue by product category.
Branch Performance: A map visualization to show sales by global branch locations.
Payment Method Preferences: A chart showing the distribution of payment methods across regions.
Sales vs. Price Correlation: A scatter plot showing the relationship between product prices and quantities sold.
